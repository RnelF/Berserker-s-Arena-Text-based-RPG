# Berserker-s-Arena-Text-based
# this is a text based rpg game which you can pick any of the the 3 classes with different starting attributes I doing this proj while I'm currently studying Vanilla Javascript which also the only language I've used from the meantime I think..

# I'm in the middle of developing this little project of mine when I finished mostly the basics of javascript soI decided to start learning Git, so here we are.. 

# and I honestly didn't think this was like a medium sized proj and it was too late when I realized it, I've already put so much time and effort getting here, but I'm determined to finish this.
