# Welcome to Berserker's Arena, a text-based RPG game where you can choose from three unique classes, each with distinct starting attributes. This project is part of my journey in learning Vanilla JavaScript, which is currently the only programming language I've used.

# I'm excited to share that I'm developing this game while diving deep into the basics of JavaScript. Recently, I also started learning Git to manage my code effectively, and here we are! 

# What began as a small project has grown into a medium-sized endeavor, and although it was a bit overwhelming at first, I've already invested a significant amount of time and effort into it. I'm determined to see it through to completion.
